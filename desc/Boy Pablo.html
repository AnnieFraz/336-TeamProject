            <img src="../img/boyPablo.jpg" alt="boy Pablo" height=100/>
            <p>18-year-old singer/songwriter Pablo Munoz started the project boy Pablo in 2016. 
            Since then, Pablo has released 3 singles and a 6-track EP. His sound can be described as happy yet melancholic, 
            and is often compared to artists like Mild High Club and Mac Demarco.
            Joining him on stage are his best friends, who have been with him through more events than most artists at the age of 18:
            the boys have played for the King and Queen of Norway, performed live on Norwegian radio (NRK) P3 Ruben, played at the 
            World Cycling Championship in Bergen, played at Norwegian festivals Slottsfjell and Bergenfest, and was the youngest booked
            artist for the industry-festival Vill Vill Vest in Bergen in 2016.

            <pModest Mouse were one of the most surprising commercial success stories of the new millennium -- 
            while their music was by turns taut and elliptical, and the lyrics sometimes cryptic and introspective,
            the band broke through to the mainstream audience with the platinum-selling Good News for People Who Love Bad News, 
            and they became genuine rock stars at a time when their musical peers remained cult figures. Modest Mouse were founded in 
            1993 by guitarist and vocalist Isaac Brock, bassist Eric Judy, and drummer Jeremiah Green. Brock, who had a nomadic childhood, 
            was only 18 and living in a shed next to his mother's trailer home when Modest Mouse began working together, with the shed becoming 
            the new band's rehearsal space and base of operations. In 1994, Modest Mouse booked time at Calvin Johnson's Dub Narcotic Studio in 
            Olympia, Washington to cut their first record, and Johnson released their debut 7",
            "Blue Cadet-3, Do You Connect?," on his K Records label. Modest Mouse soon began work on an album, 
            but the project was abandoned and the material went unreleased until 2001, when it appeared on a collection called Sad Sappy Sucker.

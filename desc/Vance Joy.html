            <p>Australian indie folk singer/songwriter Vance Joy began his career playing the Melbourne open-mike scene at the
            end of the 2000s while completing his law degree. Finding success with his intimate Bon Iver-influenced songs, Joy
            decided to put law on hold and pursue a music career instead. Born James Keogh, the singer took the name Vance Joy
            from a character in Peter Carey's novel Bliss in order to better separate his personal and professional life. 
            As his reputation grew, he began working with a manager, booking bigger shows around town and eventually recording
            his debut EP God Loves You When You're Dancing. His catchy folk-pop single "Riptide" was an immediate success in 
            Australia and eventually led him to sign a lengthy multi-album deal with Atlantic Records. In 2013, Joy began touring
            internationally and recording his first album for Atlantic. His debut Dream Your Life Away arrived in September 2014.

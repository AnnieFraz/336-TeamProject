            <h1>Whitney</h1>
            <p>Devising sauntering, country-informed indie pop, Whitney is a band built around the core songwriting duo of Julien Ehrlich, 
            formerly of Unknown Mortal Orchestra and Smith Westerns, and Max Kakacek, formerly of the latter. Ehrlich sings and plays drums, 
            while Kakacek handles guitars. Their first single, "No Woman," appeared in January 2016, and two months later they made waves with
            an appearance at the South by Southwest music festival. With a fluctuating lineup of supporting players, Whitney quickly followed
            that with opening spots on tours for NE-HI, Wild Nothing, and Unknown Mortal Orchestra. They had secured festival spots at the Governors Ball,
            Bonnaroo, and Pitchfork Music Festival, among others, before their debut album, Light Upon the Lake, arrived via Secretly Canadian that June.
            It bore an official lineup of Ehrlich, Kakacek, Malcolm Brown, Tracy Chouteau, Charles Glanders, Josiah Marshall, and Will Miller.
